A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as on their bitwise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine).  
So to start off building our computer, we will need to design the most basic part, the logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which you will build the computerâ€™s CPU and RAM chips in later projects.

## Objective
Build the following chips (we use the terms chip and gate interchangeably):
1. Nand
2. Not
3. And
4. Or
5. Xor
6. Mux
7. DMux
8. Not16
9. And16
10. Or16
11. Mux16
12. Or8Way
13. Mux4Way16
14. Mux8Way16
15. DMux4Way
16. DMux8Way
